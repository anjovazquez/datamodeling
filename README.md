# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

## Project Summary
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 
The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

Using the song and log datasets this project creates a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. 
This includes the following tables.

### Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.
#### Fact Table

* songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
        songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables

* users - users in the app
        user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
* songs - songs in music database
        song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
* artists - artists in music database
        artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
* time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
        start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday


## Relevant files

* Data
    * song_data: JSON files that contains information about songs and artists
    * log_data:  JSON files that contains event logs information.

* Scripts
    * create_tables.py drops and creates your tables. Run this file to reset your tables BEFORE EACH TIME you run your ETL scripts.
    * sql_queries.py: contains all SQL sentences: creation, drop and queries.
    * etl.py: reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into the tables.
    * etl.ipynb reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. 
      This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.

## How to run scripts

Open a terminal and execute first:

```python
python create_tables.py
python etl.py
```

## Results

### Database diagram

### Database query
```sql
SELECT * FROM songplays sp 
JOIN artists a ON a.artist_id = sp.artist_id 
JOIN songs s ON s.song_id = sp.song_id 
JOIN "time" t ON t.start_time = sp.start_time 
```

### Expected result after executing etl.py
